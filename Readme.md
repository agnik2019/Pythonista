### Inheritance is the last object-oriented programming topic in the lesson. Thus far you've been exposed to:

- Classes and objects
- Attributes and methods
- Magic methods
- Inheritance
Classes, object, attributes, methods, and inheritance are common to all object-oriented programming languages.

Knowing these topics is enough to start writing object-oriented software. What you've learned so far is all you need to know to complete this OOP lesson. However, these are only the fundamentals of object-oriented programming.

Use the following list of resources to learn more about advanced Python object-oriented programming topics.
